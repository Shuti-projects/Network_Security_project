# Network_Security_project
This project involved designing and simulating a secure two-site corporate network connecting Stockholm and Göteborg in Cisco Packet Tracer. Each site was segmented into VLANs for Office, Guest, and Admin to ensure traffic separation and reduce the attack surface. Inter-VLAN routing was implemented using router-on-a-stick, and a GRE site-to-site tunnel enabled secure communication between the two locations.

A server was deployed in a dedicated VLAN with restricted access, while DHCP pools were configured with reserved addresses for management. Multiple security measures were applied, including SSHv2 access, port-security on switches, ACLs for traffic control, and guest VLAN isolation. All configurations were tested for proper routing, DHCP assignments, tunnel connectivity, and enforcement of access restrictions.

The project highlighted the importance of network segmentation, access control, and monitoring to protect critical resources. It also demonstrated practical skills in VLAN configuration, routing, tunneling, device hardening, and network testing. Overall, the simulation provided hands-on experience in building and securing a multi-site enterprise network.
